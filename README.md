# Lone
###### Language One, L1

Lone is a language I am defining and implementing for educational
purposes, but also an interest in seeing some of my ideas applied. Lone is very
C-like, I intend to match C's capability with some unique style.

## TODO

- [ ] Define a grammar to start with
- [ ] Write some examples and define syntax and semantics more
- [ ] Implementation...

## Grammar

Check the EBNF grammar in `GRAMMAR`.
