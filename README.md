###### Match C's capability in style

Beau is a language I am defining and implementing for learning purposes,
but also an interest in seeing some of my ideas applied. Beau will match C's
capability in style. I want a utilitarian systems language that is pleasing to
the eye.

Some of the ideas I've brought to the language are originally inspired by the
original B language but with my own twist. 

### Status

compiler up and running.
