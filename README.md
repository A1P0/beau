# Lone/L1
###### **L**anguage **one**, L1

Lone/L1 is a language I am defining and implementing for learning purposes,
but also an interest in seeing some of my ideas applied. L1 will be very C-like,
I intend to match C's capability with some unique style.

## TODO

- [ ] Define a grammar to start with
- [ ] Write some examples to define syntax and semantics more
- [ ] Implementation...

## Grammar

Check the EBNF grammar in `GRAMMAR`.
