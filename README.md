# Lone/L1
###### **L**anguage **one**, L1

L1 is a language I am defining and implementing for learning purposes,
but also an interest in seeing some of my ideas applied. L1 will be very C-like,
I intend to match C's capability with some unique style.

## TODO

- [x] Define a grammar to start with
- [x] Lexer
        - Some little bits missing that will be completed at a later stage.
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Code generation

## Grammar

Check the EBNF grammar in `GRAMMAR`.

## Examples

Check some examples of what I'm going for in `examples.l1`.
